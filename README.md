# We ♥︎ Poems Lab
We like poems! We found this cool external API called Poemist that returns four random poems. Let's make an app where we can add these poems to our faves collection, and then make comments on it because we can.

**Target Goal:** 
When I press the button, four random poems appear as cards onscreen. 
If I press the button again, they are replaced with four new poems.
